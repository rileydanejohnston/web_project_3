## About
_From Portland to Portland is a site about different travel destinations in the United States. The site is a combination of HTML and CSS. The main focus of this project was using relative units and media queries in CSS to make the site responsive._

## Future Improvements
1. Experiment with different fonts to add a more personal touch to the site.
2. Add prefixes to improve cross-browser functionality.
3. Make the page transition more smoothly when going between breakpoints.
4. Fix elements that don't behave at certain breakpoints.
